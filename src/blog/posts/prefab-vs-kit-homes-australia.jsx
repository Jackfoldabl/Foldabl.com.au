    { q: "Are prefab and kit homes the same?", a: "No. Prefab/modular homes are built as finished modules in a factory and installed on site; kit homes ship materials for on‑site assembly by owners/builders." },
    { q: "Which is faster to move into?", a: "Prefab/modular usually delivers faster because modules arrive near‑complete and installation is coordinated by professionals." },
    { q: "Do approvals differ?", a: "Planning rules vary by council/state; both require compliance. Prefab homes often navigate approvals efficiently because specifications are standardized." }

        “Prefab homes” typically refer to modular homes produced in a factory
        as completed sections, then transported and installed on site. “Kit
        homes” are material packages assembled on site by the owner or a
        builder. Both aim to reduce time and costs, but the experience and
        outcomes differ significantly.

      <p className="mt-3">
        If you want a done‑for‑you solution with predictable timing, prefab
        modular homes offer the most control and speed. If you prefer DIY or
        have builder arrangements, a kit home can be a fit — but account for
        site variables.
