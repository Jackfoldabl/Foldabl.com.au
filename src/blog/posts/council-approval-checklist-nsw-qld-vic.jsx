        Council pathways for modular and prefab homes differ by state and
        council. This checklist highlights common requirements across NSW, QLD
        and VIC, and notes where outcomes often vary. Our team manages
        lodgement and communication so you aren’t left navigating regulations
        alone.

      <p className="mt-3">
        Each state framework uses different terms and pathways. Regardless of
        the label, your application must address setbacks, height, services and
        overlays. We tailor documentation to meet local expectations.
