      <p className="mt-4 text-lg">
        When you need safe, liveable accommodation fast — after a life event,
        for a family member, or to add an income‑generating granny flat —
        modular homes offer rapid, predictable delivery without the complexity
        of a traditional build.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-8 text-2xl font-medium">What counts as “emergency” or rapid installation?</h2>
      <p className="mt-3">
        In most Australian councils, “emergency” refers to urgent housing needs
        but you still must meet planning and compliance requirements. The good
        news: modular homes are designed for speed and compliance.
